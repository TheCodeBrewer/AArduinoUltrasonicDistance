# Arduino Ultrasonic Distance
Arduino (HC-SR04) Ultrasonic Sensor displays the distance on the (1602) LCD Module in cm.

This is just a simple program I wrote for an Arduino Mega 2560 board with a generic ultra-sonic sensor and a 16x2 LCD display board. The main point for me is just to learn how to write C++ and gain experience with hardware and software interactions.
Also, I think I have to mention that the code was uploaded to the Arduino via the Arduino IDE, otherwise you might have to include the Arduino.h library for this to work.

These kits are a good introduction in my opinion.

This code is free to use for anyone.

Happy learning!
