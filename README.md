# Arduino Ultrasonic Distance
Arduino (HC-SR04) Ultrasonic Sensor displays the distance on the (1602) LCD Module in cm.

This is just a simple program I wrote for an Arduino Mega 2560 board with a generic ultra-sonic sensor and a 16x2 LCD display board. The main point for me is just to learn how to write C++ and gain experience with hardware and software interactions.

These kits are a good introduction in my opinion.

This code is free to use for anyone.

Happy learning!
